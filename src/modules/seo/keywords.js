I want you to generate a list of 10 keywords closely related to "cessione del credito" without duplicating any words.
Please create a markdown table with two columns "Keyword" and "Search Intent" and "Search Volume" and "Competition in float" and "Trending in %" and "organic_traffic" and "keyword_opportunity in %" and "keyword_difficulty in %" and "CTR" and "CPC" and "CPA".
The first column should be the keyword you generated, and the second column should be the search intent of the keyword (commercial, transactional, navigational, informational, local or investigational).
After the table, please print "List of same keywords separated by commas:". On the next line print the same list of keywords at the bottom separated by commas. Do not repeat yourself. Do not self reference. Do not explain what you are doing.
